     Maps are often an abstraction of the physical or conceptual world - a symbolic depiction of a space or idea that allows one to          understand and navigate unfamiliar topography or complex topology. But while most conventional charts, plans and diagrams claim to      offer an accurate, even objective picture of the world, each one is bound by the specific agendas of its creators and users.
     [...] cartographies can be altered endlessly to reflect different priorities, hierarchies, experiences, points of view and             destinations.

    Memoria in atto: l'arte della mappatura
    Se nel 1654 il salotto di Scudéry riuscì a produrre una Carte de Tendre fu perché,
    assorbite varie tattiche topografiche, tra cui la seduzione architettonica del discorso
    amoroso di Polifilo, aveva proceduto a elaborare una sensibilità cartografica. Il salotto
    sapeva non soltanto osservare, ma anche "sistemare" un discorso in un paesaggio e
    disporlo topograficamente. Si trattava di un tipo di sapere reso accessibile grazie al legato
    dell'arte della memoria, che consentiva di trasformare il savoir topografico in arte della
    mappatura.

    +    Finn describes how an algorithmic object of study is a system-in-motion and the most fertile spot for investigation is the gap between an algorithm’s intended functionality and its effects – that is where epistemological bias, problematic data or training, or unchecked cyberlibertarianism will reveal itself.

"A Word, GOD in different languages implies the cultural complexity and the difference in our world, and the name of god is influenced by each religious contexts, racial exchanges, and invasions throughout human history. While the racial mixing all over the world at the moment, the segregation is also becoming vivid recently, and it’s needed to reconfirm the diversity of the world from a bird’s‐eye with the real data. The Internet was basically considered to represent the diversity at the beginning though, now that we tend to look at only what we like or just automatically recommended information. So I tried to fulfill the potential of the internet beyond the boundaries of the language." Oh my (), abstract.
