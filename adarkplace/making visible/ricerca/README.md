*These works come from a study of organic natural forms and their relationship to simple mathematical rules. Influenced by the work of D'Arcy Thompson, Alan Turing and Ernst Haeckel, they study how intricate forms of plant and coral like structures can be created by digital simulation of flow and deposition. These works use variations on an algorithm called Diffusion Limited Aggregation: a simple system of simulating growth by repeated deposition. The changes to the rules effectively represent modifications to environment that the form is growing in.*

*In Computed Curation, these flaws surface in often bizarre and sometimes poetic captions, tags and connections. Moreover, by urging the viewer to constantly speculate on the logic behind its arrangement, the book teaches how to see the world through the eyes of an algorithm.*
