***What is***

An art installation at the Peacock Visual Arts in Aberdeen that physically shows through yellow balls falling from a box on the ceiling the killings around the world, based on the publishing of online articles.

***How it works***

An acrylic box placed on the ceiling is filled with small yellow balls. This box is connected to a computer that monitors the news and every time someone is *killed* in an article give the command to drop a ball on the floor, slowly filling the room.

***What does it mean***

We wait our end, inexorably, and we can do nothing. Every ball drop we fell a sense of anxiety, and we wait the next one, and so on. And when we understand that *killing* is caused by us we must fell shame.

***What if***

What if we make it a *civil rights* installation and we drop a ball every time on the web someone publish something against race, women, culture, traditions, human rights. Maybe everything placed in a square in front of the UN buildings.
